# 30-Bit Military Command Schema Examples

This document provides comprehensive examples of how the 30-bit command schema can be used to encode various military and operational commands. Each example shows both natural language inputs and their corresponding schema mappings.

## Schema Overview

The schema uses 30 bits divided across:
- Action (6 bits): 64 possible actions
- Target (6 bits): 64 possible targets
- When (13 bits): 
  - Hour (5 bits): 0-23
  - Minute (6 bits): 0-59
  - Modifier (2 bits): exact/before/after/approximate
- Where (4 bits): 16 sectors (alpha through papa)
- Flags (3 bits): 8 possible states

## Advanced Time Patterns

### Time-Critical Sequences
- "At dawn" → 05:00-06:00, "approximate"
- "During shift change" → Known shift times, "exact"
- "Between patrols" → Known patrol schedule gaps, "exact"
- "After systems reboot" → Known maintenance schedule, "after"
- "During communications window" → Known comms schedule, "exact"
- "Before satellite pass" → Known orbital schedule, "before"

### Environmental Timing
- "After sandstorm passes" → Weather dependent, "after"
- "Before fog lifts" → Weather dependent, "before"
- "During peak traffic" → Civilian presence, "approximate"
- "In darkness" → Night hours (21:00-04:00), "approximate"
- "At minimum guard presence" → Known shift patterns, "exact"

## Advanced Flag Usage

### Compound Flag Implications
- "high_risk" + "civilian_presence" → Extreme caution required
- "stealth" + "electronic_silence" → Complete emissions control
- "weather_dependent" + "critical" → Execute despite conditions
- "abort_conditions" + "high_risk" → Zero tolerance for compromise

### Context-Dependent Flag Selection
- Urban Operations → "civilian_presence" default
- Cyber Operations → "electronic_silence" default
- Covert Operations → "stealth" default
- Combat Operations → "high_risk" default
- Time-Critical Operations → "critical" default

## Common Time Expressions

- "ASAP/now/immediately" → current time with "after" modifier
- "around/about/approximately" → "approximate" modifier
- "before sunrise" → 05:00, "before" modifier
- "by midnight" → 00:00, "before" modifier
- "after sunset" → 20:00, "after" modifier
- "during the night" → night hours, "approximate" modifier

## Common Flag Triggers

Natural language that typically triggers specific flags:
- "critical/urgent/emergency" → "critical" (3)
- "quietly/stealthy/covert" → "stealth" (1)
- "dangerous/risky" → "high_risk" (2)
- "civilians present/populated" → "civilian_presence" (5)
- "weather permitting" → "weather_dependent" (4)
- "radio silence/emissions control" → "electronic_silence" (6)
- "mission scrubbed/compromised" → "abort_conditions" (7)
